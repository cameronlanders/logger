## What is Logger?
Logger is a simple C# class that you can add to your programs or ASP.NET web applications to provide an easy-to-use logging feature that you can call from any method in your code. 

## Where can I use Logger?

Because Logger utilizes System.IO, it is limited to Microsoft&reg; Windows&reg; operating systems. The source code can easily be modified to omit or replace these variables, which would allow its use on any other operating system or framework that supports C#, such as anywhere that the open source, cross-platform version of .NET Core (Dotnet) can be used. 

Alternately: Please see my logger-python repository for a cross-platform logging solution developed in Python.

## How To Use Logger
The Logger class is currently enveloped in a namespace called Util. (Of course, you can remove this, or change it to your desired namespace.) Assuming you don't change it, you would add the following Using statement to the top of any class from which you would like to call Logger, like so:

`Using Util.Logger;`

You would then make calls to the logger class through the AppendLog method as follows:

__Example Usage:__

 `Logger.AppendLog("My Log Message Here");`

The logged entry will include the current datetime stamp. By default, this timestamp will be in the timezone where the calling procedure runs. You can modify it to use the client timezone if you plan to call Logger from the server-side code of a web application, for example. 

The specific syntax for using the timezone of the client is beyond the scope of this document, but that information is easy to find using your favorite search engine.

The output below provides just one simple example of an actual log file generated by this Logger class. You can log any kind of message, formatted any way you like. This output is just based on some tests I was running at the time.
