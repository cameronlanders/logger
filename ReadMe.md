## What is Logger?
Logger is a simple and useful class you can add to your C# programs or ASP.NET web applications to provide an easy-to-use logging feature that you can call from any method in your code. 

## Where can I use Logger?

Because Logger utilizes Windows environment variables, it is limited to Microsoft&reg; Windows&reg; operating systems. The source code can easily be modified to omit or replace these variables, which would allow its use on any other operating system or framework that supports C#, such as anywhere that the open source, cross-platform version of .NET Core (Dotnet) can be used. 

>Caveat: Logger.cs also uses System.IO to write to the log files. This may need to be modified for other operating systems.

## Files in the distribution 
- `logger.cs` - The source code for the Logger class 
- `Readme.md` - This file
 
## How To Use Logger
The Logger class is currently enveloped in a namespace called Util. So first add the following Using statement to the top of any class from which you would like to use Logger, like so:

`Using Util.Logger`

You would then make calls to the logger class through the AppendLog method as follows:

__Example Usage:__

 `Logger.AppendLog("My Log Message Here");`

The logged entry will include the current date and timestamp in the timezone where Logger is called. You can modify it to use the client timezone if you plan to call Logger from the server-side code of a web application, for example. 

the output below provides just one simple example of the actual log file generated by the Logger class. You can log any kind of message, formatted any way you like. This output is just based on some tests I was running at the time.
